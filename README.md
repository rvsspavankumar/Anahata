## 🌿 Vision

To create an emotionally intelligent AI companion that brings comfort, understanding, and healing through meaningful, private, and personalized conversations — making people feel heard, valued, and never alone.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To develop a privacy-first AI support system that adapts to users’ emotions, mimics empathetic human interaction through facial expressions and voice, and provides tools for emotional wellness, spiritual calm, and healing — especially for those who struggle to open up in real life.

- Empathy-first

## 🧠 How It Works (Non-Code Logic)

Anahata is built on a fine-tuned GPT-based model with added emotional layers. The platform doesn't solve problems — it listens with compassion. Based on mood input and previous interactions, Anahata crafts emotionally relevant responses, respecting privacy and healing space.

## 🔄 User Flow

1. User logs in or signs up  
2. Fills basic and behavioral questions  
3. Option to upload loved one’s photo (emoji generation)  
4. AI provides a welcome response; conversation begins  
5. Regular emotional score analysis after a few chats

## 📚 Research-Informed Design

Anahata is built on findings from:
- Empathy in Chatbots (JMIR 2024)
- Ethical AI & Voice Replication (Synthesia, EURASIP 2024)
- User Trust and Privacy (JASIST, CHB 2024)

Key gaps like trust, privacy, and long-term engagement are directly addressed through our personalized avatar design, opt-out features, and non-persistent memory.
