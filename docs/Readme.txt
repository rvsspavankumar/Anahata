# ■ Anahata – Emotionally Intelligent AI Companion
Anahata is an AI-powered emotional support chatbot designed to feel like you're talking to someone
who truly understands you. With a human-like presence (via emoji/memoji), personalized voice
interaction, and a privacy-first approach, Anahata offers comfort, emotional safety, and a sense of
companionship.

## ■ Vision
To create an emotionally intelligent AI companion that brings comfort, understanding, and healing
through meaningful, private, and personalized conversations — making people feel heard, valued, and
never alone.
---
## ■ Mission
To develop a privacy-first AI support system that adapts to users’ emotions, mimics empathetic human
interaction through facial expressions and voice, and provides tools for emotional wellness, spiritual
calm, and healing — especially for those who struggle to open up in real life.

## ■ How It Works (Non-Code Logic)
Anahata is built on a fine-tuned GPT-based model with added emotional layers. The platform doesn't
solve problems — it listens with compassion. Based on mood input and previous interactions, Anahata
crafts emotionally relevant responses, respecting privacy and healing space.

## ■ Research-Informed Design
Anahata is built on findings from:
- Empathy in Chatbots (JMIR 2024)
- Ethical AI & Voice Replication (Synthesia, EURASIP 2024)
- User Trust and Privacy (JASIST, CHB 2024)
Key gaps like trust, privacy, and long-term engagement are directly addressed through our
personalized avatar design, opt-out features, and non-persistent memory.
